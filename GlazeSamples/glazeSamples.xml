            <glazing id="WhiteGloss" viscosity="44"/>
            <glazing id="Yellow"/>
            <note>White was not fully dry when dipping. Yellow was brushed on top before firing. Doesn't work at all, it physically moves the underlying glaze and is unpredictable. Even though there was an overlap between the white and black, it doesnt' create any visible problems, which is a bit thought provoking when compared to the damage seen on piece 37. Seems as if the black overlapped the white. As long as the overlap is small, it is ok?</note>

            <glazing id="WhiteGloss" viscosity="50"/>
            <glazing id="Yellow"/>
            <note>Both glazes are very thick as the viscosity numbers reveals, and they appear thick too. Especially the white, it has characteristic dots. The white was across the whole. The white was still wet/cold, when dipping the black. Black on top of white doesn't work at all. I can't recall the crack on the edge before bisque firing, so it probably appeared in glaze firing. The white was glazed uneven, as can be seen on the inside.</note>

            <glazing id="IntenseBlack" viscosity="50"/>
            <glazing id="Yellow"/>
            <note>The edge is a bit rough, partly due to lack of glaze. Apart from careful handling when loading the oven, maybe it would be of help to slightly dip the edge only, once the first full dip has dried. Depends on how strong difference in thickness shows, which I suspect is very little. Shows well off the glaze. The yellow brush on glaze was dripped on before glaze firing.</note>

            <note>Masked with tape, glazed with white, waxed on top, removed tape, glazed with black, removed wax. First the wax went off when removing the tape, so I had to rewax without tape. I doubt waxing works with tape on, even if the overlap is very small. The black glaze was spectacularly uneven, lots of rinning going on. The cuts were added to hide edge damage caused when trimming, and the glaze patterns, acting as practice, accompanied the style.</note>

            <note>The edge sunk due to that the edge was too wetened when trimming.</note>

            <note>The top edge broke exactly where I had put the wax, after having glazed it with white. Did the water from the glaze, or the wax lower the duability? Lousy diipping. Lots of rinning outside and inside. Waxed spots before glazing with white, filled in with black using baloon. The black ran in two places(over the white), from the two isolated cicled. Filled in with black using a brush on the broken edge.</note>

            <note>Small spots, 1mm2, with black on white on the inside. The big circle on the black outside was done brushing with white, followed with wax on the top, followed by dipping in black. Afterwards the wax that was on top of the white was removed.</note>
