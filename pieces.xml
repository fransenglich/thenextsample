        <db:para><db:date>2007-10-29</db:date>White was not fully dry when dipping. Yellow was brushed on top before firing. Doesn't work at all, it physically moves the underlying glaze and is unpredictable. Even though there was an overlap between the white and black, it doesnt' create any visible problems, which is a bit thought provoking when compared to the damage seen on piece 37. Seems as if the black overlapped the white. As long as the overlap is small, it is ok?</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-10-29</db:date>Both glazes are very thick as the gravity numbers reveals, and they appear thick too. Especially the white, it has characteristic dots. The white was across the whole. The white was still wet/cold, when dipping the black. Black on top of white doesn't work at all. I can't recall the crack on the edge before bisque firing, so it probably appeared in glaze firing. The white was glazed uneven, as can be seen on the inside. Dropped it in the floor while photofgraphing.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-10-29</db:date>The edge is a bit rough, partly due to lack of glaze. Apart from careful handling when loading the oven, maybe it would be of help to slightly dip the edge only, once the first full dip has dried. Depends on how strong difference in thickness shows, which I suspect is very little. Shows well off the glaze. The yellow brush on glaze was dripped on before glaze firing.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-12-02</db:date>With tape, permanent wax and Mask&amp;Peel wax, the two halfs of white and black were painted out. First the black outside, then the black inside, the white inside, white outside. Time consuming, error prone process. Wouldn't surprise me if the white or black comes out contaminated. The black outside was double glazed, though it had pin holes both before and after. The white outside was glazed three times(although without full drying inbetween) in order to try to tackle pinholes. The white inside was done by filling up(yes, on top of the black with wax on top) and rolling around three times. The top edge became very thick and uneven at the end. Hard to find a masking mechanism that sticks on top of glaze.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-10-27</db:date></db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-12-16</db:date> Glazed the whole in Frosted Jade first. This went quite well, I had such a large quantity that I simply filled up the whole inside up to the rim. After, strips with "stamp"-tape that was activated with water was applied to form the T. A sewing-strip was used to ensure the tape was somewhat centered in the middle.</db:para>

        <db:para>Once done, the whole thing was waxed with permanent wax, the strips removed, and glazed with Green Hue. I think glue from the strips sticked to the glaze(or was it water, or had the wax flown in beneath? Doubt the latter), so it will be interesting to see how Green Hue will deal with that. Green Hue was extremely thick. Like an old man in acid.</db:para>
        
        <db:para>As usual this was messy, due to the strips pulling off the wax a bit(had to repair by hand with brush), glaze staying on top of the wax(had to wipe off). Both glaze batches had been extend and therefore remixed/sieved and were creamy and ran easy. Have no clue how this will turn out.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-12-22-20</db:date> Issues: tons of blister in Frosted Jade, Green Hue not gripping at the very bottom on the outside. Slight orange skin on the Green Hue here and there, perhaps caused by thickness. Beyond the problems the general idea works and it looks ok.</db:para>

        <db:para>On the outside there's a strange shift towards black at the bottom, looks like at the area where it was trimmed. Coarser surface, stronger oxidation?</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-12-16</db:date> Did the ring on the inside with guidelines on the inside by an ink pen, followed by filling in with the black. All the others were done with tape masking. The angles and straight lines were generally tricky, a Linex template was often of good help for putting a first baseline. Many angles are out of order and it's generally a bit sloppy. Leakage on many places, especially the long inside strip, due to that the tape has to be so darn tight. Quite time consuming, time is no 01:30.</db:para>

        <db:para>Afterwards the whole thing was glazed with green, which was creamy but thick. Poored on the inside and tilted around. Poored twice on the outside, if I recall correctly. Managed to drop the thing in the 65 L bucket, which explains any uneveness on the outside. The rim, as often, was rather uneven due to dripping and so on.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-12-22-20</db:date> Issues: just as <db:xref xlink:href="#P33"/> and <db:xref xlink:href="#P40"/> orange skin can be seen. If this isn't glaze thickness(which is thick) I suspect kiln contamination that turned the crap into a salt firing. At times uneven on the outside and it should have been thicker, it should have been as the inside is, a healty strong green. Pin holes here and there. At some places the underglazes was pulled away causing small artifacts. Maybe this could have been avoided by ensuring it's not a thick layer of underglaze. No, Potterycrafts LTD'a note on Underglaze Decoration states that an underglaze that "weeps" is caused by too high water content in the glaze on top, and this can be avoided by hardening(e.g firing) or using a spray gun to get a thin layer. That the rim was uneven after glazing didn't show that strongly when fired; a slight variation when looking from the side.</db:para>

        <db:para>The pinholes are almost exclusively on the outside and the outside is not as thick as the inside. So, glazing the outside four times, or push up the gravity to maybe 60 could possibly solve it.</db:para>

First the wax went off when removing the tape, so I had to rewax without tape. I doubt waxing works with tape on, even if the overlap is very small. The black glaze was spectacularly uneven, lots of rinning going on. The cuts were added to hide edge damage caused when trimming, and the glaze patterns, acting as practice, accompanied the style.</db:para>

Then the news paper was removed. Compared to using tape, the soaked paper stick much better. The other five with stripes were done by spinning the piece on an iron whirler and apply resistive wax(P3384). The white glazed was first genly brushed with water, such that the glaze would suck less, and hence not jam/drain the wax-brush. Due to rythm, the stripes come out uneven as they did.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-11-18</db:date>The clay was too wet. It collapsed slightly so I trimmed it from the inside in order to keep the inside sane.</db:para>
        <db:para>Glazed it by filling up the inside and then tilting the glaze around. Hence very long time of glazing on the inside. The outside was glazed twice by pooring while spinning. Probably thick too.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-12-22-20</db:date> Issues: orange skin(many small pin holes that doesn't reach the clay, reminds of salt/soda firing) all over it as well as pin holes. I suspect the orange skin is caused by the thickness of the glaze. The glaze lack the same kind of appearance as it has on <db:xref xlink:href="#P15"/>. But very even despite that there were uneven sections, this glaze flows well. Probably the thickness helpt. The rim is missing some glaze on the inside.</db:para>

        <db:para>Overall this the the best piece to date. The glaze issues can be considered relatively minor.</db:para>

        <db:para>Nope, the glaze trouble can't be attributed to gravity at least. Piece <db:xref xlink:href="#P32"/> has the same gravity but is flawless. It can be thickness of layer but that guy was thick as well. I suspect more and more kiln contamination. The piece was placed at the top, but maybe it's better to place ones pieces at the bottom such that the gases doesn't pass by.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-11-22</db:date>Masking escapades. First the inside and outside was completely glazed in white. The inside went well -- easy when it's big and plenty of glaze. The outside as well. Had it standing on two rulers that sat on the edge of a bucket, which was spinning with the help of a iron whirler. Taped on the outside, on top of the white glaze. The tape won't stick on top of the glaze, but it will to itself if one goes all the way around. However, it's still not enough for creating a non-leaking edge, as the fired piece will demonstrate. Though, it helps if one has an overlapping, reinforcing layer at the opposite side of what is being masked.</db:para>

        <db:para>Once the tape was in place, the white glaze at the top and at the passage was scraped and subsequently wiped off. Once done, the open sides was taped up a bit(but apparently not enough), and the passage glazed with black, and the top edge with one thick layer of yellow. Once the yellow was semi-dry, it was smoothed out with a watered brush.</db:para>

        <db:para>The tape thing doesn't work at all, it can't keep the glaze away, it's too loose. Removable wax combined with tape is a no go because the tape rips off all the wax, as seen with <db:xref xlink:href="#P15"/>. However, resistive wax(P3384) sticks strongly to the glaze, and the tape doesn't pull it off with it. All in all, black ended up pretty much everywhere. Spots on the inside, rinning on the outside, and on top of the yellow. The piece needs to be completely covered up. Bags plus tape.</db:para>

Tried to even out the porcelain afterwards with a dry, coarse sponge. Not effective. Tried soaked sponge, leading to the slip bubbling up, which was then pulled through with further sponging. A lot of bubbles were left, maybe they'll fall off in bisque fire.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-12-08</db:date> Simple but effectful trick of trimming clean and mounting a separate stem on the side. It's balance. Lousy throwing though, crack on side, will crack in bisque firing. This is maybe fancy on a big piece.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-12-31</db:date> Glazed, trying to kill blisters with Frosted Jade. Let water run on the bisqued piece first such that it absorbed plenty, in the hope that the glaze would stick better(but unfortunately less as well, but that's only as long as the first layer is wet). Glazed the inside by tilting as usual, and poored on the outside. The outside has three areas, where each area had one additional layer.</db:para>

        <db:para>The glaze had rather large particles that trickling maybe would have solved. Maybe it will be more gray instead of green for this reason.</db:para>

        <db:para>Utter crap. Looks thick and has pin holes on the only place where it looks decent: the outside where two and three layers are found. Interesting to see how the trimmed part affects the glaze. Uneven rim.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-12-31</db:date> "Glazed" it with porcelain slip. One runs into the same kind of problems as when glazing with a real glaze; finger marks, damaged rims and so on. The body had dried a bit too much, so there were plenty of crazings. So lots of trouble with this approach, maybe there's a better approach for doing white things. Razorhead's will turn out to be a prototype. How suitable.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-12-31</db:date> Trimmed it and burnished the outside up to about 5 cm to the rim. Lots of rythm, asymmetric rim, but looks like it will give an ok impression anyway. Threw the stem too; this will be a big tilting one.</db:para>

        <db:para>Threw that piece quite some months ago. Although it for the recent time have been covered with a plastic bag, it may have collected dust. Heavy bottom, wasn't trimmed, and that was a mistake.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2008-01-03</db:date> Cut a section in "Adhesive Transparent Film"(Clas Ohlson, 31.4132) for the strip with black underglaze. The film works very well, but the underglaze still easily jumps in under. Glazed randomly with Green Hue. Let the area over the underglaze sink in for a while, 3-5 seconds. Other than that glazed the thing rather randomly. The Green Hue felt thick and easily broke off.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2008-01-13</db:date> Crazings and duntings, even. Understandably though, very thick at the bottom and very thin at top. In addition, the piece have had a rough handling during hand crafting and been stored/moved around for a long time. No pin holes though, and the black strip turned out ok.</db:para>
