        <db:para><db:date>2007-10-29</db:date>White was not fully dry when dipping. Yellow was brushed on top before firing. Doesn't work at all, it physically moves the underlying glaze and is unpredictable. Even though there was an overlap between the white and black, it doesnt' create any visible problems, which is a bit thought provoking when compared to the damage seen on piece 37. Seems as if the black overlapped the white. As long as the overlap is small, it is ok?</db:para>

        <glazing idref="YellowBO" trickled="false"/>
        <db:para><db:date>2007-10-29</db:date>Both glazes are very thick as the gravity numbers reveals, and they appear thick too. Especially the white, it has characteristic dots. The white was across the whole. The white was still wet/cold, when dipping the black. Black on top of white doesn't work at all. I can't recall the crack on the edge before bisque firing, so it probably appeared in glaze firing. The white was glazed uneven, as can be seen on the inside. Dropped it in the floor while photofgraphing.</db:para>

        <glazing idref="YellowBO" trickled="false"/>
        <db:para><db:date>2007-10-29</db:date>The edge is a bit rough, partly due to lack of glaze. Apart from careful handling when loading the oven, maybe it would be of help to slightly dip the edge only, once the first full dip has dried. Depends on how strong difference in thickness shows, which I suspect is very little. Shows well off the glaze. The yellow brush on glaze was dripped on before glaze firing.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-12-02</db:date>With tape, permanent wax and Mask&amp;Peel wax, the two halfs of white and black were painted out. First the black outside, then the black inside, the white inside, white outside. Time consuming, error prone process. Wouldn't surprise me if the white or black comes out contaminated. The black outside was double glazed, though it had both before and after pin holes. The white outside glazed three times(although without full drying inbetween) in order to try to tackle pinholes. The white inside was done by filling up(yes, on top of the black with wax on top) and rolling around three times. The top edge became very thick and uneven at the end. Hard to find a masking mechanism that sticks on top of glaze.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-12-16</db:date> Glazed the whole in Frosted Jade first. This went quite well, I had such a large quantity that I simply filled up the whole inside up to the rim. After, strips with "stamp"-tape that was activated with water was applied to form the T. A sewing-strip was used to ensure the tape was somewhat centered in the middle.</db:para>

        <db:para>Once done, the whole thing was waxed with permanent wax, the strips removed, and glazed with Green Hue. I think glue from the strips sticked to the glaze(or was it water, or had the wax flown in beneath? Doubt the latter), so it will be interesting to see how Green Hue will deal with that. Green Hue was extremely thick. Like an old man in acid.</db:para>
        
        <db:para>As usual this was messy, due to the strips pulling off the wax a bit(had to repair by hand with brush), glaze staying on top of the wax(had to wipe off). Both glaze batches had been extend and therefore remixed/trickled and were creamy and ran easy. Have no clue how this will turn out.</db:para>

First the wax went off when removing the tape, so I had to rewax without tape. I doubt waxing works with tape on, even if the overlap is very small. The black glaze was spectacularly uneven, lots of rinning going on. The cuts were added to hide edge damage caused when trimming, and the glaze patterns, acting as practice, accompanied the style.</db:para>

Then the news paper was removed. Compared to using tape, the soaked paper stick much better. The other five with stripes were done by spinning the piece on an iron whirler and apply resistive wax(P3384). The white glazed was first genly brushed with water, such that the glaze would suck less, and hence not jam/drain the wax-brush. Due to rythm, the stripes come out uneven as they did.</db:para>

Lots of trouble with bending, resulting in that the stem collapsed on one side. Repaired with Saint Thomas. My conclusion of all this is that one should trimm off the stem,  throw one separately, bend the body, and then mount it on the thrown stem.</db:para>

        <db:para><db:date>2007-11-22</db:date>Masking escapades. First the inside and outside was completely glazed in white. The inside went well -- easy when it's big and plenty of glaze. The outside as well. Had it standing on two rulers that sat on the edge of a bucket, which was spinning with the help of a iron whirler. Taped on the outside, on top of the white glaze. The tape won't stick on top of the glaze, but it will to itself if one goes all the way around. However, it's still not enough for creating a non-leaking edge, as the fired piece will demonstrate. Though, it helps if one has an overlapping, reinforcing layer at the opposite side of what is being masked.</db:para>

        <db:para>Once the tape was in place, the white glaze at the top and at the passage was scraped and subsequently wiped off. Once done, the open sides was taped up a bit(but apparently not enough), and the passage glazed with black, and the top edge with one thick layer of yellow. Once the yellow was semi-dry, it was smoothed out with a watered brush.</db:para>

        <db:para>The tape thing doesn't work at all, it can't keep the glaze away, it's too loose. Removable wax combined with tape is a no go because the tape rips off all the wax, as seen with <db:xref xlink:href="#P15"/>. However, resistive wax(P3384) sticks strongly to the glaze, and the tape doesn't pull it off with it. All in all, black ended up pretty much everywhere. Spots on the inside, rinning on the outside, and on top of the yellow. The piece needs to be completely covered up. Bags plus tape.</db:para>

Tried to even out the porcelain afterwards with a dry, coarse sponge. Not effective. Tried soaked sponge, leading to the slip bubbling up, which was then pulled through with further sponging. A lot of bubbles were left, maybe they'll fall off in bisque fire.</db:para>
